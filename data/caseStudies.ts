    challenge: 'FashionForward was struggling with high cart abandonment rates and a customer support team overwhelmed with repetitive queries about product details, sizing, and shipping. They needed a scalable solution to provide instant, personalized assistance to shoppers.',
    solution: 'We developed a conversational AI Sales Agent and integrated it into their e-commerce website. The agent was trained on the entire product catalog, shipping policies, and FAQs. It uses Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to engage customers, answer questions in real-time, offer personalized style recommendations based on browsing history, and proactively guide users through the checkout process.',

    solution: 'We built an AI Recruitment Assistant to streamline the top of their hiring funnel. The agent uses NLP (via spaCy) to parse and screen resumes against job requirements, ranking candidates automatically. It then invites top candidates to a chat-based interview to ask pre-screening questions. Successful candidates are automatically sent a Calendly link to schedule an interview with a hiring manager.',

    solution: "We deployed an AI Lead Qualification Agent on their website. The agent initiates conversations with visitors, asks qualifying questions (e.g., budget, desired location, timeline), and determines their readiness to buy or sell. For qualified leads, the agent accesses real estate agents' calendars via the Google Calendar API and schedules a viewing or a call directly, then pushes the lead data into their CRM.",

We implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on thousands of annotated histology samples. The AI agent identifies and highlights potentially malignant cell formations, providing a 'second opinion' to pathologists and prioritizing critical cases.",
