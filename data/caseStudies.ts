    challenge: 'Pathologists face a significant workload analyzing histology slides, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. The client needed a solution to augment the diagnostic process, improve accuracy, and reduce turnaround times for cancer detection.',
    solution: "Wangoes developed a sophisticated AI agent powered by a custom-trained deep learning model. The agent was designed to analyze high-resolution digital slide images. We implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on thousands of annotated histology samples. The AI agent identifies and highlights potentially malignant cell formations, providing a 'second opinion' to pathologists and prioritizing critical cases.",

    solution: 'We built a cross-platform mobile application that connects to wearable devices (like smartwatches). An AI agent on the backend analyzes data streams including activity levels, sleep patterns, and heart rate variability. The app also includes daily cognitive games. The AI agent establishes a baseline for each user and flags anomalies or declining trends, sending alerts to designated caregivers via the platform.',

    solution: "We engineered the platform using the MERN stack for flexibility and performance. To ensure scalability and easy deployments, the entire application was containerized using Docker and orchestrated on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). We implemented a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment, integrated Stripe for subscription billing, and developed companion mobile apps using React Native for on-the-go learning.",

    solution: 'Our award-winning solution integrated live video feeds from drones with an AI agent running on a ground server. The agent used the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to estimate crowd density in real-time and identify potential stampede risks. For the lost-and-found feature, users could report a missing person via a mobile app, and the AI agent would use facial recognition to scan the drone feeds for potential matches.',
    results: [
      'Won 1st place in the Public Safety category of the hackathon.',
      'Demonstrated real-time crowd density mapping with over 90% accuracy.',
